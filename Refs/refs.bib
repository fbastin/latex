  Abstract                 = { We present a modification of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems. Like the original simulated annealing algorithm, our method has the hill climbing feature, so it can find global optimal solutions to discrete stochastic optimization problems with many local solutions. However, our method differs from the original simulated annealing algorithm in that it uses a constant (rather than decreasing) temperature. We consider two approaches for estimating the optimal solution. The first approach uses the number of visits the algorithm makes to the different states (divided by a normalizer) to estimate the optimal solution. The second approach uses the state that has the best average estimated objective function value as estimate of the optimal solution. We show that both variants of our method are guaranteed to converge almost surely to the set of global optimal solutions, and discuss how our work applies in the discrete deterministic optimization setting. We also show how both variants can be applied for solving discrete optimization problems when the objective function values are estimated using either transient or steady-state simulation. Finally, we include some encouraging numerical results documenting the behavior of the two variants of our algorithm when applied for solving two versions of a particular discrete stochastic optimization problem, and compare their performance with that of other variants of the simulated annealing algorithm designed for solving discrete stochastic optimization problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze an equilibrium model for traffic networks based on stochastic dynamic programming. In this model passengers move towards their destinations by a sequential process of arc selection based on a discrete choice model at every intermediate node in their trip. Route selection is the outcome of this sequential process while network flows correspond to the invariant measures of the underlying Markov chains. The approach may handle different discrete choice models at every node, including the possibility of mixing deterministic and stochastic distribution rules. It can also be used over a multi-modal network in order to model the simultaneous selection of mode and route, as well as to treat the case of elastic demands. We establish the existence of a unique equilibrium, which is characterized as the solution of an unconstrained strictly convex minimization problem of low dimension. We report some numerical experiences comparing the performance of the method of successive averages (MSA) and Newton's method on one small and one large network, providing a formal convergence proof for MSA.},

Generally, the initial temperature is set such that the acceptance ratio of bad moves is equal to a certain value $\chi$0. In this paper, we first propose a simple algorithm to compute a temperature which is compatible with a given acceptance ratio. Then, we study the properties of the acceptance probability. It is shown that this function is convex for low temperatures and concave for high temperatures. We also provide a lower bound for the number of plateaux of a simulated annealing based on a geometric cooling schedule. Finally, many numerical experiments are reported.},

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents a new integer programming (IP) model for large-scale instances of the air traffic flow management (ATFM) problem. The model covers all the phases of each flight—i.e., takeoff, en route cruising, and landing—and solves for an optimal combination of flow management actions, including ground-holding, rerouting, speed control, and airborne holding on a flight-by-flight basis. A distinguishing feature of the model is that it allows for rerouting decisions. This is achieved through the imposition of sets of “local” conditions that make it possible to represent rerouting options in a compact way by only introducing some new constraints. Moreover, three classes of valid inequalities are incorporated into the model to strengthen the polyhedral structure of the underlying relaxation. Computational times are short and reasonable for practical application on problem instances of size comparable to that of the entire U.S. air traffic management system. Thus, the proposed model has the potential of serving as the main engine for the preliminary identification, on a daily basis, of promising air traffic flow management interventions on a national scale in the United States or on a continental scale in Europe. },

  Abstract                 = {Although various airport landing sequencing algorithms have been considered in the literature, little work has been done in comparing their effects on Air Traffic Control, especially against first-come first-served (FCFS) runway sequences, the method most widely used in practice. This paper compares a number of such algorithms using a discrete-event simulation model of an airport with a single landing runway. Statistical methods are used to test for effects of sequencing algorithm, delay-sharing strategy, arrival rate and wake-vortex mix. Little benefit to delay, or stability of sequencing advice, is found from advanced sequencing when small changes are made to inputs calibrated to a specific airspace. Advanced sequencing improves landing rate, compared with FCFS sequencing, only when aircraft arrival rate is greater than maximum runway landing rate, and wake-vortex mix is sufficiently varied. Constrained position shifting constraints limit these improvements and it is shown that deterministic optimal techniques may actually be sub-optimal in a dynamic environment. Our main conclusion is that FCFS is a robust method under many conditions.},

In particular, we focus on the traditional probabilistic model proposed in the literature. The approach we study consists of solving a sequence of two-stage stochastic programs with simple recourse, which can be viewed as an approximation to a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation to the seat allocation problem. Our theoretical results show that the proposed approximation is robust, in the sense that solving more successive two-stage programs can never worsen the expected revenue obtained with the corresponding allocation policy. Although intuitive, such a property is known not to hold for the traditional deterministic linear programming model found in the literature. We also show that this property does not hold for some bid-price policies. In addition, we propose a heuristic method to choose the re-solving points, rather than re-solving at equally-spaced times as customary. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Many applications require either the maximisation or minimisation of a function. For example, in many fields of theoretical physics, a sum of least squares must be minimised, or the energy of a system must be minimised. Many of the standard numerical techniques which exist for the optimisation of functions apply to functions which can be specified in a relatively straightforward manner. However, many of the functions which arise in the modelling of semiconductor devices cannot be specified in this manner, and some of these functions can only be evaluated using many subsidiary functions and integrals. Genetic algorithms allow such sets of functions to be optimised using random processes to ``breed'' generations of solutions which should converge to the optimal solution. This chapter presents an introduction to genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. Sections of code written in C++ are used to illustrate the implementation of aspects of the subjects. The coefficients involved in the numerical approximation of the associated Fermi integrals are evaluated using these methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we generalize the well-known Nesterov's accelerated gradient (AG) method, originally designed for convex smooth optimization, to solve nonconvex and possibly stochastic optimization problems. We demonstrate that by properly specifying the stepsize policy, the AG method exhibits the best known rate of convergence for solving general nonconvex smooth optimization problems by using first-order information, similarly to the gradient descent method. We then consider an important class of composite optimization problems and show that the AG method can solve them uniformly, i.e., by using the same aggressive stepsize policy as in the convex case, even if the problem turns out to be nonconvex. We demonstrate that the AG method exhibits an optimal rate of convergence if the composite problem is convex, and improves the best known rate of convergence if the problem is nonconvex. Based on the AG method, we also present new nonconvex stochastic approximation methods and show that they can improve a few existing rates of convergence for nonconvex stochastic optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the convergence of the AG method has been established for solving nonconvex nonlinear programming in the literature.},

It is shown that for a certain class of noise distributions, the convergence assertion remains valid, provided that the standard deviation of the noise is reduced in the successive steps of cost function evaluation (e.g., by repeated observation) with a speed O(k -$\gamma$ ), where $\gamma$ is an arbitrary constant larger than one.},

The important difference from scenario reduction in two-stage models consists in incorporating the filtration distance.

  Optabstract              = { Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. },

The Mirrlees-Rogerson conditions do not work if the principal can observe more than one observable statistic. Also, the Mirrlees-Rogerson assumption that the distribution function of output is convex in the agent's action is unsatisfactory even in the context of the basi c model; it is too restrictive. The paper presents a suite of conditio ns that are applicable to the multistatistic case and replaces the objectionable convex distribution function assumption.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we prove new complexity bounds for methods of convex optimization based only on computation of the function value. The search directions of our schemes are normally distributed random Gaussian vectors. It appears that such methods usually need at most n times more iterations than the standard gradient methods, where n is the dimension of the space of variables. This conclusion is true for both nonsmooth and smooth problems. For the latter class, we present also an accelerated scheme with the expected rate of convergence {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}Big ({\{}n^2 {\backslash}over k^2{\}}{\backslash}Big ){\$}{\$} O ( n 2 k 2 ) , where k is the iteration counter. For stochastic optimization, we propose a zero-order scheme and justify its expected rate of convergence {\$}{\$}O{\backslash}Big ({\{}n {\backslash}over k^{\{}1/2{\}}{\}}{\backslash}Big ){\$}{\$} O ( n k 1 / 2 ) . We give also some bounds for the rate of convergence of the random gradient-free methods to stationary points of nonconvex functions, for both smooth and nonsmooth cases. Our theoretical results are supported by preliminary computational experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The evaluation of the expectation of a given function of a solution of an SDE with jumps provides via the Feynman-Kac formula, see Sect. 2.7, the solution of a partial integro differential equation. In many applications it is of major interest to obtain numerically these expectations, in particular in multi-dimensional settings. Monte Carlo simulation appears to be a method that may be able to provide answers to this question under rather general circumstances. However, raw Monte Carlo estimates of the expectation of a payoff structure, for instance for derivative security prices, can be very expensive in terms of computer resource usage. In this chapter we investigate the problem of constructing variance reduced estimators for the expectation of functionals of solutions of SDEs that can speed up the simulation enormously. We follow again closely Heath (1995). As we will see, variance reduction is more of an art and can be applied in many ways. This chapter shall enable the reader to design her or his own variance reduction method for a given problem at hand.},

  Abstract                 = { We study robust formulations of assortment optimization problems under the multinomial logit choice model. The novel aspect of our formulations is that the true parameters of the logit model are assumed to be unknown, and we represent the set of likely parameter values by a compact uncertainty set. The objective is to find an assortment that maximizes the worst-case expected revenue over all parameter values in the uncertainty set. We consider both static and dynamic settings. The static setting ignores inventory consideration, whereas in the dynamic setting, there is a limited initial inventory that must be allocated over time. We give a complete characterization of the optimal policy in both settings, show that it can be computed efficiently, and derive operational insights. We also propose a family of uncertainty sets that enables the decision maker to control the trade-off between increasing the average revenue and protecting against the worst-case scenario. Numerical experiments show that our robust approach, combined with our proposed family of uncertainty sets, is especially beneficial when there is significant uncertainty in the parameter values. When compared to other methods, our robust approach yields over 10\% improvement in the worst-case performance, but it can also maintain comparable average revenue if average revenue is the performance measure of interest. },

  Abstract                 = {We analyze the stochastic average gradient (SAG) method for optimizing the sum of a finite number of smooth convex functions. Like stochastic gradient (SG) methods, the SAG method's iteration cost is independent of the number of terms in the sum. However, by incorporating a memory of previous gradient values the SAG method achieves a faster convergence rate than black-box SG methods. The convergence rate is improved from {\$}{\$}O(1/{\backslash}sqrt{\{}k{\}}){\$}{\$} O ( 1 / k ) to O(1 / k) in general, and when the sum is strongly-convex the convergence rate is improved from the sub-linear O(1 / k) to a linear convergence rate of the form {\$}{\$}O({\backslash}rho ^k){\$}{\$} O ( $\rho$ k ) for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}rho < 1{\$}{\$} $\rho$ < 1 . Further, in many cases the convergence rate of the new method is also faster than black-box deterministic gradient methods, in terms of the number of gradient evaluations. This extends our earlier work Le Roux et al. (Adv Neural Inf Process Syst, 2012), which only lead to a faster rate for well-conditioned strongly-convex problems. Numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm often dramatically outperforms existing SG and deterministic gradient methods, and that the performance may be further improved through the use of non-uniform sampling strategies.},

  Optabstract              = { Customer choice behavior, such as buy-up and buy-down, is an important phenomenon in a wide range of revenue management contexts. Yet most revenue management methodologies ignore this phenomenon—or at best approximate it in a heuristic way. In this paper, we provide an exact and quite general analysis of this problem. Specifically, we analyze a single-leg reserve management problem in which the buyers' choice behavior is modeled explicitly. The choice model is very general, simply specifying the probability of purchase for each fare product as a function of the set of fare products offered. The control problem is to decide which subset of fare products to offer at each point in time. We show that the optimal policy for this problem has a quite simple form. Namely, it consists of identifying an ordered family of “efficient“ subsets S1, …, Sm, and at each point in time opening one of these sets Sk, where the optimal index k is increasing in the remaining capacity x and decreasing in the remaining time. That is, the more capacity (or less time) available, the further the optimal set is along this sequence. We also show that the optimal policy is a nested allocation policy if and only if the sequence of efficient sets is nested, that is S1 ⊆ S2 ⊆ … ⊆Sm. Moreover, we give a characterization of when nesting by fare order is optimal. We also develop an estimation procedure for this setting based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method that jointly estimates arrival rates and choice model parameters when no-purchase outcomes are unobservable. Numerical results are given to illustrate both the model and estimation procedure. },

  Optabstract              = {We study advance selling in a model with a capacity constraint for the seller and in the presence of both consumer heterogeneity and demand uncertainty. Buyers face different levels of uncertainty about their valuations in the advance selling period: one group of buyers (called informed buyers) know their individual valuations while the other group (called uninformed buyers) only know the distribution of their valuations. We find that the seller's optimal pricing strategy depends on his capacity size as well as the size of informed buyers. For a small capacity size, the Constant Price strategy with the highest possible price is adopted. For sufficiently large capacity sizes, both Advance Purchase Discount and Advance Purchase Premium strategies may be optimal. In general, the larger the size of informed buyers the more likely an Advance Purchase Premium strategy is adopted.},
